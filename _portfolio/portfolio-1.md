We developed a Machâ€“Zehnder interferometer employing a phase-shifting technique to measure variations in air density. The setup, installed at Tohoku University in Sendai, was initially used to investigate the influence of boundary layer thickness on the density distribution in the presence of sound waves. In future work, we plan to explore more complex dynamics coupling acoustic and heat exchanges, e.g. edge effects at the outlet of porous materials.
