excerpt: 'The absorption of airborne sound is still a subject of active research, and even more since the emergence of acoustic metamaterials. Although being subwavelength, the screen barriers developed so far cannot absorb more than 50% of an incident wave at very low frequencies (<100 Hz). Here, we explore the design of a subwavelength and broadband absorbing screen based on thermoacoustic energy conversion. The system consists of a porous layer kept at room temperature on one side while the other side is cooled down to a very low temperature using liquid nitrogen. At the absorbing screen, the sound wave experiences both a pressure jump caused by viscous drag, and a velocity jump caused by thermoacoustic energy conversion breaking reciprocity and allowing a one-sided absorption up to 95 % even in the infrasound regime. By overcoming the ordinary low frequency absorption limit, thermoacoustic effects open the door to the design of innovative devices.'
