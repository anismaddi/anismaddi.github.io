excerpt: 'Non-Hermitian topology offers a promising avenue toward an enhanced control of waves, and many of the
underlying interesting phenomena are studied through the paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson (HN) model, which
remains unexplored in continuous wave systems. Herein, we propose a framework to map one-dimensional
continuous nonreciprocal systems onto the HN model. Our approach, based on the properties of transfer matrices,
is applicable across various physical domains. We experimentally apply our method in audible acoustics using
active elements, where we not only observe the predicted skin effect but also access the spectrum topology using
stable configurations and observe its subsequent boundary sensitivity. By establishing a connection between
continuous wave systems and the discrete HN model, our results significantly broaden the potential application
of nonreciprocal topological phenomena.'
